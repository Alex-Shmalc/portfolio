	<h2>Introduction</h2>
	<section>
	<p>Hi there, my name is Alex Malcolm. I am 27 years old and live in Tampa, FL. I am currently working for a printing company as a machine technician. I also, to this day, can't spell technician properly on the first try!

	<h2>About Me</h2>
	<section>
	<p>I'm very interested in what I've learned about web development so far. I find the mentality when approaching coding very similar to the mentality needed when fixing complicated machinery. I'm excited to finish the program and get some real world experience collaborating with others on development.
	</p>
	</section>
	<section>
	<p>Outside of web development I enjoy playing music and had until recently been creating guitar pedals and modifying vintage synths. I enjoy tinkering with the circuitry and see what sounds you can make.

<footer>
It said I needed a footer so heres a footer. I know you typically want a footer to be contact but I thought the contact looked abit weird down here so I made the footer this instead. Also the more I look at footer the weirder it looks. footer. hm.
