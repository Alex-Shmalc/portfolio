	    <h2>About Me</h2>
	<p>I'm very interested in what I've learned about web development so far, here's an ordered list of what I feel about it so far!</p>
    <ul>
      <li>I find the mentality when approaching coding very similar to the mentality needed when fixing complicated machinery.</li>
      <li> I'm excited to finish the program and get some real world experience collaborating with others on development.</li>
	    </ul>
	</section>
	<section>
	<p>Outside of web development I enjoy playing music and had until recently been creating guitar pedals and modifying vintage synths. I enjoy tinkering with the circuitry and see what sounds you can make.

<footer>
It said I needed a footer so heres a footer. I know you typically want a footer to be contact but I thought the contact looked abit weird down here so I made the footer this instead. Also the more I look at footer the weirder it looks. footer. hm.
